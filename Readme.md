Problem statement :-
AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodra. They want to expand to other metro/tier1 cities in the next 2 years.

AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend the annual contract due to service issues. It is speculated that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their supply chain analytics team to track the ’On time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery service level for all the customers on a daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.

The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which they will measure ‘on-time delivery (OT) %’, ‘In-full delivery (IF) %’ and OnTime in full (OTIF) % of the customer orders on a daily basis against the target service level set for each customer.

Insights :- 
Top Level KPI's (OT%, IF%, OTIF%) are very much  behind the target 
Coolblue,Acclaimed Stores,Lotus Mart are top 3 customers who have experienced lowest in terms of On time delivery and Full delivery 
Across all the months there has been no significant improvement in terms of meeting these customers expectation 
AM Butter 250 is the number one product for our top 3 above customers where Atliq mart has failed to do on On time delivery and Full delivery 

MY Questions from Looking at Insights :-
Is there a Low production of AM Butter 250 ? 
Is the sales Person of Coolblue,Acclaimed Stores,Lotus Mart not able to get proper estimate quantity requirement from them ? 
what are the reasons for which delivery is being delayed and no improvement may be talk to delivery partners to list down issues ?
