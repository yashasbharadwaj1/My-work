## Problem Statement

AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India, and is currently operational in three cities: Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodra. The company plans to expand to other metro/tier-1 cities in the next two years.

AtliQ Mart is facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend their annual contracts due to service issues. It is speculated that some essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, leading to poor customer service. Management wants to resolve this issue before expanding to other cities and has requested their supply chain analytics team to track the ‘On Time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery service levels for all customers on a daily basis to respond swiftly to these issues.

## Task

Create the metrics according to the metrics list. Develop a dashboard based on the dashboard expectations.

## Insights

- Top Level KPIs (OT%, IF%, OTIF%) are significantly behind the target.
- Coolblue, Acclaimed Stores, and Lotus Mart are the top 3 customers who have experienced the lowest on-time and full delivery rates.
- Across all months, there has been no significant improvement in meeting these customers' expectations.
- AM Butter 250 is the number one product for our top 3 customers where AtliQ Mart has failed to achieve on-time and in-full delivery.

## Questions from Insights

1. Is there a low production of AM Butter 250?
2. Are the salespersons of Coolblue, Acclaimed Stores, and Lotus Mart not able to get proper quantity estimates from these customers?
3. What are the reasons for the delivery delays, and why has there been no improvement? Should we talk to delivery partners to identify the issues?
